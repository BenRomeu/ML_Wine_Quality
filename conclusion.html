Overall, all of our machine learning models tend to predict fairly well wine quality with the AAN MLP models outperforming their counterparts. The least performing model is the kNN, which appears to be slightly less efficient according to its ROC curve. <br><br>
After further analysis, alcohol, volatile acidity and free sulfur dioxide seem to be the most important features when classifying wine quality in our experiment.<br><br>
We obtained an average accuracy of more or less 80% in all different models, which is quite satisfying with the constraints assigned to them. Indeed, due to storage and responsiveness limits, we had to cap the power of our models by limiting for example to only 3 layers the neural network, limiting k to only 80 for kNN and work with limited number of nodes in decision trees. However, we could argue that if we extended their predicting capacities, the risk of overfitting could become non-negligible.<br><br>
In addition, we could potentially improve their performance by proceeding to better cross-validation (for example 10-fold cross-validation) as we only took the end of observations for testing them.<br><br>
Machine learning models are powerful tools for pattern recognition. We hope this simple example has shown how theses models might be useful in other statistical settings.
