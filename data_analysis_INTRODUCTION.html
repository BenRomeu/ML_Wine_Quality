<h4>Introduction</h4>
The database is composed of two datasets which are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.<br><br>
For our analysis we focused exclusively our attention on the white wine dataset.<br><br>
The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests. For our experiment we divided quality (a range from 1 to 9) into a binary factor: Good & Bad, following the rule : Good >= 6. <br><br>
Initially we have chosen to assign the Good label to wines whose quality was superior or equal to 7. But due to non-significant results, we re-evaluated our decision with the consequence that we there are now more Good wines then Bad ones. <br><br>
